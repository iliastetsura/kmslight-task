Things to automate:
I would definitely automate the "Book a demo" form, since I notice that there are redirects to this form from many pages in the system. This makes the form an important feature.
Tests to create:
- UI tests for form validation. Example - check validation for each field on the form
- UI tests for form submitting. Example - submit the form using different sets of values
- API tests for form requests. Example - test POST requests
